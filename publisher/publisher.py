    Convert an IPython notebook into an HTML file that can be consumed
    by GitHub pages in plotly's documentation repo.

    Arguments:
    - notebook_name: The name of the notebook to convert.
                     Used as input arg to nbconvert, nowhere else.
    - url_path: e.g. /python/offline
    - page_title: The <title> of the page.
    - page_description: So, what's this page about?
                        Sell it in 160 characters or less.
                        This is the <meta name="description"> tag.
    - ignore_last_n_cells: When converting to HTML, don't convert the
                           ignore_last_n_cells number of cells.
                           This is usually the cell that runs this `publish`
                           command and the blank output cell that is always
                           included.
    - uses_plotly_offline: If this was created with plotly.offline, then set
                           this to True. This will include an extra lib
                           (jquery) that is included in ipython notebook,
                           but not included in gh-pages
    - thumbnail_url: Used as a thumbnail image on the notebook splash
                     (if applicable) and as the image when sharing the
                     notebook as a tweet, a facebook post, etc.
                     Can be relative to the repo, eg '/images/static-image'
                     or absolute, e.g. http://i.imgur.com/j0Uiy0n.jpg
    - language: Not sure what this is used for.

    Example:
    publish('Plotly Offline',
            '/python/offline',
            'Plotly Offline for IPython Notebooks',
            'How to use Plotly offline inside IPython notebooks with Plotly Offline',
